## Unfinished taks

* Not displaying the list of makers in the Post detail screen. Only showing the username of the first maker. I could do it with a horizontal list to show the list of makers
* Not showing list of tags in the post detail screen
* The list should load more as the user scrolls
* has infinite scroll list of post items the user has voted for
